Description: |
    **qaul.net** is a free software suite,
    which enables everyday devices, such as laptops and smartphones
    to create an internet independent **decentralised and open**
    ad-hoc wireless mesh network.
    It supports both public and private text messaging, voice calls,
    audio broadcasts and file sharing â€” all in a single app.

    **Independent** of existing wireless and celular infrastructure,
    it empowers users to share ideas and organise, circumventing
    government censorship and corporate surveillance.

    In addition to this, it provides a **powerful service library**,
    which enables others to write applications that communicate
    and interact with an existing qaul network.
Decentralisation: |
    Online communication has become something that everybody depends on, 
    usually via centralised services and infrastructure. It might even 
    sometimes seem like there's no real alternative to staying in touch 
    with people this way.
    
    Throughout the years, there have been many occurences of governments 
    shutting down parts of this infrastructure, or systematically attacking
    centralised services in order to shut down people's ability to organise.
    It was one of thes occurences that inspired the creation of qaul.net 
    in 2012.
    
    Since then the project has grown and evolved. We seek to abolish the
    traditional way of building infrastructure. Working with many other
    projects (notebly Freifunk), and learning from many ideas, we not only
    aim to build tools for the next revolution, but also for a new way of
    networking people and communities together.
