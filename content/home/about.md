Introduction_Title: What is qaul.net?
Introduction: |
    **qaul.net** is a set of tools, that allows devices like laptops 
    and smartphones to create a **wireless mesh network** over Bluetooth 
    and direct WiFi connections, rather than relying on internet access
    via a mobile network.  This **decentralised and open network** extends
    across any qaul.net-enabled device, so that if two people aren't close
    enough to each other for their devices to connect directly, data can
    be sent via other devices in the middle, without those devices being
    able to read or change the messages passing through it.

    It supports instant messaging, voice calls, social media, radio
    broadcast, and file sharing â€” all in a single app.  Additionally it is
    a suite of **free software libraries**, meaning that anyone can study
    and modify it, and use it to create their own apps that can operate on
    a qaul network, independent of the internet.
Meshing_Title: What is a mesh network?
Meshing: |
    In traditional network infrastructure there is a centralised point
    between you and the Internet: your Internet service provider (ISP).
    Whether you're using a  mobile network tower or a broadband connection,
    your access to the Internet is controlled by a central authority.  This
    means that a entity can monitor or censor your internet traffic.

    In a mesh network there is no network owner. Instead, every user's devices
    link together directly to create a new network where data can flow
    without regulation or control.

    To create these connections, devices can use a variety of methods,
    such as WiFi and Bluetooth, or plain network cables to create links
    with other qaul.net users around them.

    The network that is created by qaul.net can serve two purposes:
    to connect you with people around you to run applications specifically
    made for qaul.net, or to act as a tunnel to the traditional Internet.
