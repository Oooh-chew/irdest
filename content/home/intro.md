Resilient_Title: Build resilient networks
Resilient: | 
    Whether against an oppressive government or a natural disaster,
    centralised infrastructure is vulnerable to censorship and direct
    attacks.  qaul.net makes it much harder to shut down a network because
    all participants in it become part of the way data is routed
Extensible_Title: An extensible architecture
Extensible: |
    Each network is a collection of many devices, communicating via
    many different technologies and applications.  Third party applications
    can interact with a qaul network without having to solve a lot of hard
    problems around mesh communication
FOSS_Title: Free and open-source software
FOSS: |
    qaul.net is not owned by a single company or legal entity.  All code
    is licensed under a free software license, meaning it will remain open
    and free to use, study, and adapt for anyone, forever
