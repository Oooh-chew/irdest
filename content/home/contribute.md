    The project is currently undergoing a rewrite.  Many of the core tools
    are already done, but user-facing applications are lacking.  The easiest
    way to get into **qaul.net** is to download the Linux `hub` binary and
    join the open-qaul.net test network. [Find out how!](/Learn#hubd)
    
    If you have trouble setting up the hub server, check out the 
    [Learn](learn) page to find documentation on both
    user configuration, as well as code-internal docs.
    
    Development happens on your 
    own [gitlab](https://git.open-communication.net/qaul) instance, where
    you can also find various open issues.  If you have more questions
    about the project or just want to see how things are going, check out
    the [Community](/community) page.
