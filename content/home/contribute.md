    **Do you have questions about the project or want to talk to us about
    qaul.net?  Check out the [Community](/community) page to learn how.**

    The project is currently undergoing a rewrite.  Many of the core tools
    are already done, but user-facing applications are lacking.  The easiest
    way to get into **qaul.net** is to download the Linux `qaul-hubd` binary
    and joining the open qaul.net test network.

    If you have trouble setting up the hubd server, check out the 
    [Learn](/learn#manuals) page to find user manuals, and documentation
    on both code-internals, and qaul.net protocol descriptions.
