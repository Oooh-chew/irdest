# Irdest clients

As part of the Irdest project we develop several applications to go
with the core networking router [Ratman](../ratman).  Some of these
should be considered tech-demos, while others enable you to use
existing networking applications (for example curl or your favourite
XMPP client) across an Irdest mesh network!

Following is a short list of available clients and their aproximate
state of usability.

| Client name                    | Last release version | Status    | Description                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [irdest-echo](./irdest-echo)   | 0.1.0                | Done      | A small example application showing how to use the Ratman client SDK             |
| [irdest-proxy](./irdest-proxy) | -                    | Prototype | A local socket proxy allowing you to tunnel IP traffic through an Irdest network |
