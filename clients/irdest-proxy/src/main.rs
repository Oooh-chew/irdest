//! Irdest Proxy allows you to send IP data through an Irdest network
//!
//! It uses (at some point in the future) a few different mechanisms
//! to achieve this:
//!
//! - Simple socket + port mapped to a Ratman address
//!
//! - Tap device mapping a whole IP space to a Ratman address
//!
//! - Tap device mapping different IP spaces to different Ratman
//!   addresses, using dynamic route announcements (a la BGP).
//!
//! Currently ___0___ of these mechanisms are implemented :)
