# Test JSON RPC API

There are shell scripts over which you can test all the functions 
of the JSON RPC API.

The bash test scripts are located in the folder [tests/json-rpc](https://git.qaul.org/qaul/qaul/-/tree/develop/tests%2Fjson-rpc) of the qaul repository.

How to execute and use the test scripts is documented in the [README.md](https://git.qaul.org/qaul/qaul/-/blob/develop/tests/json-rpc/README.md) file in the test script folder.
