Do you have questions about irdest?  Trouble setting up your client?
Or do you want to help out with development?  We have an active
community and development chat on Matrix:  [#irdest:fairydust.space][matrix].

For more long-form discussions, updates on design proposals, or to
submit patches we also have a [mailing list][mail]!

The main code repository lives on our own [gitlab
instance](https://git.irde.st/we/irdest).
