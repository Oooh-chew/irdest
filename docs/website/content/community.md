Do you have questions about qaul?  Trouble setting up your client?
Or do you want to help out with development?  We have an active
community and development chat on matrix:  [#qaul.net:fairydust.space][matrix].

For more long-form discussions, announcements, and work-logs there is
also a mailing list, hosted on [lists.sr.ht/~qaul/community][mail].
We would be happy to answer your questions on either of those
platforms.

The main code repository lives on our own [gitlab
instance](https://git.qaul.org/qaul).
