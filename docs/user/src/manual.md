# Building this manual

This manual is part of the main source repository and you can build it
from the same [nix](./nix.md) environment as the rest of the project.


```console
$ cd docs/users
$ mdbook build
```


If you want to enable live-reloading to work on this manual, you can
also use the dev server.

```console
$ mdbook serve
```
