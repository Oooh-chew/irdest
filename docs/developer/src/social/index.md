# Social Documentation

This section outlines the social structure of the irdest project.


## Communication

The irdest project uses [Matrix] as a development and social
chat. Feel free to drop by to ask questions or hang out!

## Code of Conduct

**TLDR:** be nice!

We want to foster an open and engaging atmosphere for irdest and the
development community around it.  Because of this we follow the
["Contributor Covenant" code of conduct].  A copy of it should have
been included in the sources for this book.
