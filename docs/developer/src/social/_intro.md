# Social Documentation

This section outlines social structures of the qaul project, to
make engaging with us as easy as possible!


## Communication

free to drop by!

## Code of Conduct

**TLDR:** be nice!

We want to foster an open and engaging atmosphere for qaul and the development community around it.
Because of this we follow the ["Contributor Covenant" code of conduct].
A copy of it should have been included in the sources for this book.
