## Submitting an MR

- If a relevant issue exists, please tag in your description
- Include a short description of the accumulative changes
- If you want your history to be rebased/ merged, please clean it up
  to be useful.  Otherwise we will probably squash it.
- Feel free to open a work-in-progress MR as a place to have a
  discussion about changes or to get feedback.
