# Ratman Installer

This is a small, statically built program that is distributed with the
static Ratman bundle.  Its job is to copy files into the correct
locations, and detect upgrades and downgrades of versions.

You can customize the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` variables
to determine where Ratman will be installed, and where its
configuration will be stored.
